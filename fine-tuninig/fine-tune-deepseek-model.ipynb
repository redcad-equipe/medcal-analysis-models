Let me start by going through the information given.\n\nFirst, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing, but she doesn't leak at night. That makes me think about possible causes. She undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. I'm not entirely sure what the Q-tip test entails, but I think it's a test to check for urethral obstruction or urethritis. So, if the Q-tip test is positive, it might suggest that her urethra isn't opening properly, causing the obstruction.\n\nNow, the question is about what cystometry would show. Cystometry is a test where they fill the bladder and measure how much it holds (residual volume) and how the detrusor muscle contracts during filling. \n\nIf she has involuntary urine loss, especially with coughing, that's often related to overactive bladder or urethral issues. Overactive bladder can cause the detrusor to contract too easily, leading to involuntary contractions without filling the bladder completely, which would show up in the cystometry as high detrusor activity. Alternatively, if there's urethral obstruction, the bladder might not empty properly, leading to residual volume.\n\nGiven that she's 61, maybe she's postmenopausal, which can affect bladder function. Also, if the Q-tip test is positive, urethral obstruction is likely, so the bladder might have difficulty emptying completely. That would mean higher residual volume because not all the urine is emptied. \n\nWait, but she doesn't leak at night, so her night-time bladder capacity is normal. That suggests that her problem is more related to daytime bladder control, not nighttime. So, the issue is likely daytime urgency and incontinence due to overactive bladder or urethral obstruction.\n\nIn terms of detrusor contractions, if it's overactive bladder, the detrusor contracts too often, leading to small volume contractions. But during cystometry, they fill the bladder, and the contractions are measured. If the detrusor is hyperactive, the contractions would be more frequent or stronger, leading to more emptying attempts, which could cause more leakage. Alternatively, if there's obstruction, the detrusor might not contract properly, but I think in that case, the residual volume would be higher because the bladder isn't emptying.\n\nSo, putting it together, the cystometry would likely show an increased residual volume because the urethra isn't opening fully, and possibly detrusor hyperactivity if it's overactive bladder. Alternatively, it might show normal residual volume but high detrusor activity if it's more about the muscle contractions.\n\nI think the key points are that the residual volume would be increased due to urethral obstruction, and the detrusor might show hyperactivity if it's a functional issue like overactive bladder. So the response should mention both aspects.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the cystometry is expected to reveal an increased residual volume due to urethral obstruction, as indicated by the positive Q-tip test. Additionally, detrusor hyperactivity, likely associated with an overactive bladder, may also be observed. This combination suggests a multifactorial cause, potentially involving both functional bladder issues and structural urethral problems.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training prompt style by adding </think> tag\ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with and input that provides further context.\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\nPlease answer the following medical question.\n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T21:57:21.317590Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T21:57:21.317933Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T21:57:21.322849Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T21:57:21.317907Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T21:57:21.322071Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Loading the dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\", \"en\", split=\"train[0:500]\", trust_remote_code=True)\ndataset","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T21:48:01.938220Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T21:48:01.938564Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T21:48:05.849740Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T21:48:01.938536Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T21:48:05.848987Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.25k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d94a376a466a4b5ab67548663fc52196"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/74.1M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3119fa10267146c6afec418a211ffce6"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/25371 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"29af4d1a52964a88a22f89203a3f4aef"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset[1]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T21:48:28.158014Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T21:48:28.158313Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T21:48:28.165003Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T21:48:28.158290Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T21:48:28.164295Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use, who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, presents with sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors. Given this clinical presentation and history, what is the most likely diagnosis?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Alright, let’s break this down. We have a 45-year-old man here, who suddenly starts showing some pretty specific symptoms: dysarthria, shuffling gait, and those intention tremors. This suggests something's going wrong with motor control, probably involving the cerebellum or its connections.\\n\\nNow, what's intriguing is that he's had a history of alcohol use, but he's been off it for the past 10 years. Alcohol can do a number on the cerebellum, leading to degeneration, and apparently, the effects can hang around or even appear long after one stops drinking.\\n\\nAt first glance, these symptoms look like they could be some kind of chronic degeneration, maybe something like alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, but hold on. This looks different. The symptoms just came on all of a sudden. Chronic degenerations typically have a more gradual onset.\\n\\nOkay, let’s reconsider this sudden nature. It’s making me think of something more acute, more rapid onset. Hmm, if we dig back into his history of drinking, there might have been some damage done, leading to nutritional deficiencies, like a lack of thiamine.\\n\\nWernicke’s encephalopathy is a classic possibility here. That condition pops up due to thiamine deficiency, often after a history of alcohol use. It’s known for causing ataxia, confusion, and eye movement issues. However, he’s not showing the full triad of symptoms; there's no mention of confusion or eye problems, so maybe it doesn’t fit perfectly.\\n\\nOh, wait a second, maybe we're missing something simpler. Given the acute nature of the symptoms, maybe this is more in line with something like a stroke. Sudden onset can definitely suggest a vascular event. With his alcohol history, he’s at risk for things like high blood pressure, which can increase stroke risk.\\n\\nIn particular, lacunar strokes can mess with motor coordination, speech, the works. These are small, but significant enough to cause these exact symptoms: dysarthria, tremors, and a shuffling gait.\\n\\nBut hang on, what if there’s another angle we’re missing? Chronic alcohol effects might still play a role here, just in a different way. There’s a condition called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration. This can happen in people with a history of liver disease due to alcohol, even years after they’ve quit. It can result in symptoms like these because of how substances get deposited in the brain.\\n\\nLinking this back to our patient, his history with alcohol could’ve led to some liver issues, and now, here we are with these symptoms showing up suddenly. Makes sense, right? So, considering everything, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration seems to fit quite nicely. That’s probably our most fitting diagnosis for this situation.\",\n 'Response': \"Considering the clinical presentation of sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors in a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, the most likely diagnosis is acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.\\n\\nThis condition is associated with chronic liver disease, which can often be a consequence of long-term alcohol use.

Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \\n\\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence.\\n</think>\\nCystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Setting LoRA => adds small, trainable adapters to specific layers\nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model, \n    r=16,\n    target_modules=[\n        \"q_proj\",\n        \"k_proj\",\n        \"v_proj\",\n        \"o_proj\",\n        \"gate_proj\",\n        \"up_proj\",\n        \"down_proj\"\n    ],\n    lora_alpha=16,\n    lora_dropout=0,\n    bias=\"none\",\n    use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\",\n    random_state=3407,\n    use_rslora=False,\n    loftq_config=None\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T22:07:54.006739Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T22:07:54.007198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T22:08:00.059745Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T22:07:54.007149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T22:08:00.058851Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.1.8 patched 32 layers with 32 QKV layers, 32 O layers and 32 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Initialize the finetuning trainer\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model = model_lora,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune,\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dataset_num_proc=2,\n    \n    #Training arguments\n    args = TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,\n        num_train_epochs=1,\n        warmup_steps=5,\n        max_steps=60,\n        learning_rate=2e-4,\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        logging_steps=10,\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",\n        weight_decay=0.01,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",\n        seed=3407,\n        output_dir=\"outputs\"\n    )\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T22:16:43.608151Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T22:16:43.608468Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T22:16:46.040141Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T22:16:43.608444Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T22:16:46.039455Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"854b3ce999cf45e0b483dc577aaf3a5c"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Start the finetuning process\ntrainer_stats = trainer.train()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T22:19:27.378358Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T22:19:27.378744Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T22:44:41.499431Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T22:19:27.378695Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T22:44:41.498575Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"==((====))==  Unsloth - 2x faster free finetuning | Num GPUs = 1\n   \\\\   /|    Num examples = 500 | Num Epochs = 1\nO^O/ \\_/ \\    Batch size per device = 2 | Gradient Accumulation steps = 4\n\\        /    Total batch size = 8 | Total steps = 60\n \"-____-\"     Number of trainable parameters = 41,943,040\n\u001b[34m\u001b[1mwandb\u001b[0m: \u001b[33mWARNING\u001b[0m The `run_name` is currently set to the same value as `TrainingArguments.output_dir`.

We have a 61-year-old woman who's been dealing with involuntary urine loss during things like coughing or sneezing, but she's not leaking at night. That suggests she might have some kind of problem with her pelvic floor muscles or maybe her bladder.\n\nNow, she's got a gynecological exam, and they're doing a Q-tip test. I know the Q-tip test is usually used to check for urethral obstruction, especially in women. If the test shows a high resistance, it might mean there's something blocking the urethra, like a urethral stricture or a narrowed urethra.\n\nBut we're also thinking about what this could mean for her bladder. If there's a urethral obstruction, the bladder could be having trouble emptying itself, which might lead to a full bladder. That could mean she's retaining more urine than usual.\n\nNow, let's consider what cystometry might show. Cystometry is like a test to see how the bladder behaves under different conditions. If the bladder is really full, she might have a higher residual volume. And if there's something like a urethral obstruction, there might be some difficulty in emptying, which could mean more contractions in the detrusor muscles.\n\nSo, putting this together, if she's experiencing involuntary urine loss and there's a high resistance in the Q-tip test, we might expect her to have a higher residual volume. Also, there could be more detrusor contractions, meaning the bladder is contracting more to try to push out the urine, but it's not getting out as easily.\n\nThis makes sense because if there's a urethral obstruction, the bladder would need to work harder, and that could lead to more contractions. And if she's holding onto more urine, it would naturally result in a higher residual volume. So, this all lines up with what we'd expect from her symptoms and the Q-tip test findings.\n\nI think this makes sense, but I should double-check if there's anything I'm missing. Maybe there's another condition that could explain her symptoms differently, but nothing comes to mind. So, I'm pretty confident in this line of reasoning.\n</think>\nBased on the information provided, the 61-year-old woman likely has a urethral obstruction, which can cause difficulty in emptying the bladder. This obstruction, possibly indicated by a high resistance during the Q-tip test, suggests a urethral stricture or narrowing. Consequently, her bladder may be retaining more urine, leading to a higher residual volume. Additionally, the detrusor muscles might be contracting more frequently and with greater force to try to expel the retained urine, which aligns with the symptoms of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing. Therefore, cystometry is expected to reveal a higher residual volume and increased detrusor contractions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\n# Ensure the directory exists\nos.makedirs(\"Mouhib007/DeepSeek-r1-Medical-Mini\", exist_ok=True)\n\n# Push to Hugging Face Hub\nmodel_lora.push_to_hub_merged(\"Mouhib007/DeepSeek-r1-Medical-Mini/model\", tokenizer, save_method=\"merged_16bit\", token=hugging_face_token)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T22:54:44.468706Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T22:54:44.469026Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T23:00:29.206134Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T22:54:44.469003Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T23:00:29.205417Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth: You are pushing to hub in Kaggle environment.\nTo save memory, we shall move Mouhib007/DeepSeek-r1-Medical-Mini/model to /tmp/model\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"Unsloth: Merging 4bit and LoRA weights to 16bit...\nUnsloth: Will use up to 16.76 out of 31.35 RAM for saving.\nUnsloth: Saving model...
